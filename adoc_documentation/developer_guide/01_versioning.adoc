== Versioning

=== Version numbers

Version numbers X.Y.Z.label should be understood like this:

* X: Major version, a major version adds new features and breaks compatibility with previous major and minor versions.
* Y: Minor version, a minor version adds new features and does not break compatibility with previous minor versions for
the same major version.
* Z: Patch, a patch version only contains bug fixes of current minor version
* Label: pre-release or build metadata:
** SNAPSHOT: a version whose development is in progress, nightly builds only deliver SNAPSHOT versions
** RELEASE: a version whose development is finished

=== Releasing Version

IMPORTANT: To release a version we use some Travis dedicated jobs. These jobs are triggered by specific commit keywords and rely
on the VERSION file at the root of this repository to know which version is being produced.
It is thus crucial to double-check the content of this file before any push (triggering the Travis jobs) is made.

Before releasing a version, you need to prepare the release.

Considering a version X.X.X.SNAPSHOT.

==== In the source repository (operatorfabric-core)

. Use the ./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh script to automatically perform all the necessary changes:
+
```
./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh
```
+
This will perform the following changes:
+
* Replace X.X.X.SNAPSHOT with X.X.X.RELEASE in *.adoc, swagger.yaml files and the VERSION file at the root operator-fabric folder
* Update the revision date in *.adoc files (by default, the new revision date is today, but see the script usage for details)
* Change the version from W.W.W.RELEASE (previous release) to X.X.X.RELEASE in the deploy docker-compose file
+
IMPORTANT: The VERSION file is particularly important as the CI/CD pipeline tasks
(building the documentation and the docker images for example) are based on it.

. Commit with the template message:
+
```
[RELEASE] X.X.X.RELEASE (ci_docker,ci_documentation)
```
+
The commit comment leverages these three keywords to trigger the delivery of documentation and docker images, so you should
check that they are correctly spelt.

* ci_docker: triggers the build and upload of versioned docker images to dockerhub
* ci_documentation: triggers the build and upload of the current documentation

. Tag the commit with the version
+
```
git tag X.X.X.RELEASE
```

. Push the commit
+
```
git push
```

. Push the tag
+
```
git push origin X.X.X.RELEASE
```

. Check that the build is correctly triggered
+
You can check the status of the build job triggered by the commit on https://travis-ci.org/opfab/operatorfabric-core/branches[Travis CI].
The build job should have the following three stages:
+
image::running_build.png[Running build status page screenshot]
+
Wait for the build to complete (around 30 minutes).

. Check that the X.X.X.RELEASE images have been generated and pushed to DockerHub.

. Check that the latest images have been updated on DockerHub.

. Check that the documentation has been generated and pushed to the GitHub pages website (check version and revision
date at the top of document)
+
NOTE: You won't be able to access it from the homepage until you have <<In the documentation repository (opfab.github.io),updated the _version.yml file>> in the opfab.github.io
repository, so instead you can just type https://opfab.github.io/documentation/X.X.X.RELEASE/developer_guide/ in your browser.

. Check that the tag was correctly pushed to GitHub and is visible under the
https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/releases[releases page] for the repository.

==== Checking deploy docker-compose

The deploy docker-compose file should always rely on the latest RELEASE version
available on DockerHub. Once the CI pipeline triggered by the previous steps has completed successfully,
and you can see X.X.X.RELEASE images for all services on DockerHub, you should:

. Remove your locally built X.X.X.RELEASE images if any
. Run each of the two docker-compose files to make sure they pull the images from DockerHub and behave as intended.

==== In the documentation repository (opfab.github.io)

. In the _data/versions.yml file:
+
* Change:
+
```
- name: X.X.X
  fullname: X.X.X.SNAPSHOT
  badges:
  - name: SNAPSHOT
    style: badge-snapshot
```
to:
+
```
- name: X.X.X
  fullname: X.X.X.RELEASE
  badges:
  - name: RELEASE
    style: badge-release
  - name: CURRENT
    style: badge-current
```
* Then remove the following lines from the previous release version:
+
```
  - name: CURRENT
    style: badge-current
```
+
. Commit and push changes

==== In Jira

. Set all concerned tickets (US, BUG, FR) and set fix version to X.X.X.RELEASE

. In the "Releases" screen release X.X.X.RELEASE version

=== Advertising the new release (opfab.github.io and mailing list)

. Click the appropriate version from
https://opfab.atlassian.net/projects/OC?orderField=RANK&selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin%3Arelease-page&status=all[JIRA the release list]
to get the release notes (click "Release notes" under the version name at the top) listing new features, fixed bugs etc...
+
image::release_notes.png[Release notes link]

. Take this text and use it
to create a short post on the opfab.github.io repository (under _posts) announcing the release.
This post should highlight new features and necessary upgrade actions if any.

. Send the same content as an email to the opfab-announce@lists.lfenergy.org mailing list.

=== Preparing next version

IMPORTANT: You should wait for all the tasks associated with creating the X.X.X.RELEASE
version to finish and make sure that they've had the expected output before starting the
preparation of the next version. This is because any committed/pushed changes preparing the
new version will make rolling back or correcting any mistake on the release more complicated.

To prepare a next version you simply need to increment the version after a release (see <<Version numbers>>).

==== In the source repository (operatorfabric-core)

. Use the ./CICD/prepare_snapshot_version.sh script to automatically perform all the necessary changes:
+
```
./CICD/prepare_snapshot_version.sh --version Y.Y.Y.SNAPSHOT
```
+
This will perform the following changes:
+
* Replace all occurrences of X.X.X.RELEASE by Y.Y.Y.SNAPSHOT **EXCEPT** in the deploy docker-compose file
(src/main/docker/deploy/docker-compose.yml). The files concerned are *.adoc,
swagger.yaml files and the VERSION file at the root operatorfabric-core folder.
+
IMPORTANT: The VERSION file is particularly important as the CI/CD pipeline tasks
(building the documentation and the docker images for example) are based on it.
+
NOTE: If no --version parameter is provided to the script, the new version will be the next minor version.
+
. Add a Y.Y.Y.RELEASE.adoc file (blank except for copyright and title) under src/docs/asciidoc/release_notes to initialize the release
notes for next version.
+
. Edit src/docs/asciidoc/release_notes/index.adoc to include this new file (before the previous versions so it appears on top).
+
. Commit and push changes with the following message:
+
```
[PREPARE] next version: Y.Y.Y.SNAPSHOT
```

==== In the documentation repository (opfab.github.io)

. In the _data/versions.yml file, add the Y.Y.Y.SNAPSHOT version
+
```
- name: Y.Y.Y
  fullname: Y.Y.Y.SNAPSHOT
  badges:
  - name: SNAPSHOT
    style: badge-snapshot
```

. Commit and push changes.

==== In Jira

. In the "Releases" screen create a  Y.Y.Y.RELEASE version.

==== Checking DockerHub the following day

A CRON Travis job runs daily (the time of the day may vary) and generates the documentation and docker snapshot images.
After you have finished switching to the Y.Y.Y.SNAPSHOT version, you should wait for such a job to run and check that
the snapshot images are correctly generated and pushed on DockerHub.
